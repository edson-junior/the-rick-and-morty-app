## The Case
Using the API: https://rickandmortyapi.com/

Display the following:
- Show all characters that exist (or are last seen) in a given dimension
- Show all characters that exist (or are last seen) at a given location
- Show all characters that partake in a given episode
- Showing all information of a character (Name, species, gender, last location, dimension, etc)

## Run App
To run the app, run:

```bash
cd rick-and-morty-case
npm install
npm run dev
```

The App will run on port 7777

## Stack
Here's what I used to build the app:

- Next.js (React) with Server Side Rendering
- Apollo Client
- Styled Components
- Eslint
- Prettier
- Jest & Enzyme (I would've used React Testing Library but there was no time to learn yet another tool)
- Husky & Lint-staged for the pre-commit hook

---

## Notes
Because I wanted to do something a bit nicer, I've actually only learned Next.js for this project! ðŸ˜‰
Koen expressed his wish to see some of it, so I got cracking with the docs reading and tutorials.

I understand I'll be getting some tips, so I'd like some tips on how you guys do unit tests on a Next.js App.

Because I decided to build the App with Next, I didn't have enough time to add some of the bonuses, like Dockerizing the App, adding an extra API.

I'm about to drop a bombshell right now, but I have never seen Rick and Morty!
I got a lot on my plate at work and a baby at home. I don't even have hobbies anymore! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
